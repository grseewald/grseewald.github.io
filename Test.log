./Test.tex:7: LaTeX Error: The font size command \normalsize is not defined:
               there is probably something wrong with the class file.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.7 \begin{document}
                    
Your command was ignored.
Type  I <command> <return>  to replace it with another command,
or  <return>  to continue without it.

./Test.tex:8: Undefined control sequence.
l.8   \maketitle
                
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
